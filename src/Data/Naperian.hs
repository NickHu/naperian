Portability : unportable

This module contains the typeclasses which describe static-sized containers
algebraically.

Instances of Naperian ought to satisfy the law that:

@
  tabulate . lookup = id = lookup . tabulate
@

Some generic operations for working with Naperian types are also provided.

-- | Naperian functors.
-- A useful way of thinking about a Naperian functor is that if we have a value
-- of type @v :: f a@ for some @'Naperian' f@, then we can think of @f a@ as a
-- bag of objects, with the ability to pick out the @a@ values inside the bag,
-- for each and every @a@ inside @f@. For example, in order to look up a value
-- @a@ inside a list @[a]@, we could use a function @[a] -> Int -> a@, which is
-- exactly @'(Prelude.!!)'@
--
-- The lookup function acts like a logarithm of the @'Functor' f@. Intuitively,
-- a Haskell function @f :: a -> b@ acts like the exponential @b^a@ if we intuit
-- types as an algebraic quantity. The logarithm of some value @x = b^a@ is
-- defined as @log_b(x) = a@, so given @x@ and a base @b@, it finds the exponent
-- @a@. In Haskell terms, this would be like finding the input value @a@ to a
-- function @f :: a -> b@, given a @b@, so it is a reverse mapping from the
-- outputs of @f@ back to its inputs.
--
-- A @'Naperian'@ functor @f@ is precisely a functor @f@ such that for any value
-- of type @f a@, we have a way of finding every single @a@ inside.

  {-# MINIMAL lookup, (tabulate | positions) #-}

  -- | The \"logarithm\" of @f@. This type represents the 'input' you use to
  -- look up values inside @f a@. For example, if you have a list @[a]@, and
  -- you want to look up a value, then you use an @'Int'@ to index into
  -- the list. In this case, @'Log' [a] = Int@. If you have a type-bounded
  -- Vector @'Vector' (n :: 'Nat') a@, then @'Log' ('Vector' n)@ is the
  -- range of integers @[0..n-1]@ (represented here as @'Finite' n@.)
